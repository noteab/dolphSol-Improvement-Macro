## FAQ (Will add more questions soon)
-- Congratulate to everyone who patiently complete my installation & instruction guide, so this is how you use the command correctly --

(1) If you open the discord_cmd.py but the slash command in your discord wont show up? What should you do? --> Use "/sync" command and refresh the discord page, it should be update all the existing command list for you. Or uncomment await bot.tree.sync() in async def on_ready() and refresh your discord browser then comment that bot.tree.sync() (prevent from being ratelimited)

(2) For the reconnection, I have reverted back to deeplink method, auto detection sol rng server shutdown message and roblox disconnect popup, after reconnect it will reset the camera angle to let the AHK macro do its job properly.

(?) Soon...
